# exercism
Testing Exercism using Github Codespaces.

Can I run tests? Is it a pain in the butt?

Last time I checked, the Visual Studio Online version of Visual Code _didn't have copy and paste_.  Has that changed? (I hope so!)

Would it be attractive to do Exercism work on my Pixelbook Go in a browser, instead of just warming up the Linux system and using a 'vanilla' Linux environment? 

LET'S FIND OUT!
